# NDde

This library provides a convenient and easy way to integrate .NET applications with legacy applications that use
Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE). DDE is an older interprocess communication protocol that relies heavily on passing
windows messages back and forth between applications. Other, more modern and robust, techniques for interprocess
communication are available and should be used when available. This library is only intended to be used when no
other alternatives exist.
